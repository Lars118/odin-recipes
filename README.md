I will be putting all of my HTML knowledge i have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, i am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time i have finished.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops.
