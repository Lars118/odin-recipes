    <h2>So what is a cheeseburger?</h2>
    <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, which allows the cheese to melt.</p>

    <h3>For this recipe you will need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams beef mince</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>8 slices of american cheese</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>1 brown onion</li>
        <li>4 dill pickles</li>
        <li>ketchup</li>
        <li>mustard</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Now that you have everything, let's start making these delicious burgers!</h3>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Place the beef mince and a generous amount of salt and pepper into a large mixing bowl.</li></p>
        <p><li>Mix the meat in your hands until combined and separate into four equal portions.</li></p>
        <p><li>Flatten the meat into patties, being careful not to break the edges. Rest on a board or plate until you are ready to cook.</li></p>
        <p><li>Use a flat barbeque hotplate or large frying pan and heat the oil over high heat. Place the flattened patties into the pan and cook until a crust forms on the bottom (around 4 minutes).</li></p>
        <p><li>Flip the patties and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add two cheese slices to each patty and allow the cheese to melt over the top for a further two minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the patties to rest for at least 4 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>To assemble, add the meat patties to the brioche buns and top with the chopped onion, sliced pickles, ketchup and mustard. Serve immediately with chips, wedges and extra pickles. Enjoy!</li></p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Follow these tips to master the perfect cheeseburger, every time. You will be holding one of these classic, juicy cheeseburgers in your hands in no time!  
    </p>

    <p><strong>Use a cheaper beef mince.</strong></p>
    <p>Hey. Who are we kidding? Cheeseburgers are not the healthiest of foods. But when you are eating one, you want it to be the best! With burgers, choose a fatty beef mince. Cheaper beef mince has a higher fat content and ensures you'll end up with a juicier burger patty.</p>

    <p><strong>For the patties, keep it simple.</strong></p>
    <p> used to add eggs to my minced meat for burger patties. And sauces and spices. Sometimes even breadcrumbs!
        But for burgers, simple is best. All you need is a (very) generous amount of salt and pepper for your patties. Nothing else. Trust me! All you need is a nice fatty beef mince, salt and pepper.
        Roll the patties in your hands and gently flatten to the right size. They will shrink a little while cooking, so make them slightly larger than the buns.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Only flip once.</strong></p>
    <p>Like a perfect steak, burger patties only need to be flipped once. Too much flipping and the meat will dry out and fall apart. Use a little oil on the hotplate and a high heat. Let a crust form on the bottom and then flip. A medium burger will be done in around eight minutes and will have a perfectly crispy shell.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Don't press the patty!</strong></p>
    <p>Don't press the burger patty during cooking. This will push out all of the juices. Handle as little as possible during the cooking process.</p>
