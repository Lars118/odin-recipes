<h2>About this recipe</h2>
<p>This Vegetable Soup has become one of my <strong>most popular</strong> soup recipes and for good reason! It's <strong>healthy</strong>, it's <strong>comforting</strong> and <strong>1,000 times better than what you'll get in a can!</strong> Full of flavor and so easy to make you can't go wrong with a big warm bowl of vegetable soup.</p>

    <h3>Now that all the ingredient's are there let's start making the soup!</h3>

        <ol>

            <p><li>Add onions, carrots, and celery and saute 4 minutes then add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer.</li></p>
            <p><li>Add in broth, tomatoes, potatoes, parsley, bay leaves, thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bring to a boil, then add green beans. </li></p>
            <p><li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until potatoes are almost fully tender, about 20 - 30 minutes. </li></p>
            <p><li>Add corn and peas and cook for 5 minutes longer. Serve warm.</li></p>

        </ol>

        <h3>Notes!</h3>
            <p><strong>boosting flavour</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <p><li>For more flavor add in more dried herbs (or even triple the amount of dried thyme). Other good herbs to add include basil, oregano, rosemary, marjoram, or Italian seasoning.</li></p>
                <p><li>Another option to add more flavor is to use a homemade chicken stock or vegetable broth.</li></p>
                <p><li>You can also add a corn cob (that corn kernels have been cut from) in step 3 if using fresh corn.</li></p>
                <p><li>It's also delicious to simmer a parmesan rind in with the soup, then remove at the end when removing bay leaves.</li></p>
                <p><li>Optionally you can finish servings with grated parmesan and a splash of extra virgin olive oil.</li></p>
            
            </ul>
